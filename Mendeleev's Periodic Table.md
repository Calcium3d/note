# Define
The physical and chemical properties of the elements are the periodic function of their atomic weight. 

# Merits
1) Simplified and systemised the study of the elements and their compounds
2) Correcting the doubtful atomic masses of some elements

# Defects
1) The position of hydrogen could not be justified
2) The position of isotopes was not clear
3) It has been found that some elements with higher atomic number preceeds the element with lower atomic mass
4) The position of lanthanides and actinides are not properly assigned

# What is it?
[[Free radicals]] formed from [[Homolysis of a bond fission]]

It is similar to [[Stability of Carbocation]]

[[Free radicals]] are [[electrons]] deficient species where carbon carries a single unpaired [[electrons]]. Alkyl groups due to their [[+I effect]] can release [[electrons]]. More the number of alkyl groups attached to a carbon radical, more is the availability of [[electrons]] and more is the stabilization of [[Free radicals]]. Thus, [[electrons]] deficiency in carbon radicals is compensated to maximum in tertiary radicals due to the presence of three alkyl groups.

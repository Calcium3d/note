# Discovery
Electrical discharge carried out in a modified cathode ray tube from [[Micheal Faraday]] led to the discovery of particles carrying positive charge, known as canal rays.

The smallest and lightest positive ion was obtained from hydrogen and was called proton. It was later characterised in 1919

# Characteristics
* Unlike cathode rays, the positively charged particles depend upon the nature of gas present in the cathode ray tube. These are simply the positively charged gaseous ions
* The charge to mass ratio of the particles is found to depend on the gas from which these originate. 
* Some of the positively charged particles carry a multiple of the fundamental unit of electrical charge
* The behaviour of these particles in the magnetic or electrical field is opposite to that observed for electron or cathode rays

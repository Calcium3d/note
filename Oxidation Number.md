# What is it?
[[Oxidation]] number of the element is defined as the residual charge which its atoms has or appears to have when all other atoms from the molecule are assumed to be removed as ions by counting the shared [[electrons]] with more electronegative form.

It is extremely important to find out [[Redox Reaction]].

# Calculation
## ON of Hydrogen
* It is +1

### Exceptions
* In metallic hydride the ON of hydrogen is -1
	* $NaH$, $\ce{CaH2}$

## ON of oxygen
* It is +1

### Exceptions
* In [[Peroxide]] ON of oxygen is -1
* ON of Oxygen is +2 in oxygen difluoride
* ON of oxygen is -1 in dioxygen difluoride

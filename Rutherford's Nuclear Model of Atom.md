[[Rutherford]] bombarded very thin gold foil with $\alpha$-particles. The alpha particles scattered around and produced some interesting results

# Observation

* Most of the $\alpha$-particles passed through the gold foil undeflected
* A small fraction of the $\alpha$-particles was deflected by small angles
* A very few $\alpha$-particles bounced back, that is, were deflected by nearly 180.

# Results
* most of the space in the [[atom]] is empty as most of the $\alpha$-particles passed through the foil undeflected
* A few positively charged $\alpha$-particles were deflected. The deflection must be due to enormous repulsive [[force]] showing that the positive charge of the [[atom]] is not spread throughout the [[atom]] as Thomson had presumed. The positive charge has to be concentrated in a very small volume that repelled and deflected the positively charged $\alpha$-particles
* Calculations by Rutherford showed that the volume occupied by the nucleus is negligibly small as compared to the total volume of the [[atom]]. The radius of the [[atom]] is about $10^{-10}m$, while that of nucleus is $10^{-15}m$. One can appreciate the difference in size by realising that if a cricket ball represents a nucleus, then the radius of [[atom]] would be about 5km

# The model
* The positive charge and most of the mass of the [[atom]] was densely concentrated in extremely small region. This very small portion of the [[atom]] was nucleus by Rutherford.
* The nucleus is surrounded by electrons that move around the nucleus with a very high speed in circular paths called orbits. Thus Rutherford's model of [[atom]] resembles the solar system in which the nucleus plays the role of sun and the electrons that of revolving planets
* Electrons and the nucleus are held together by electrostatic forces of attraction

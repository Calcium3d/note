# What is it?
$$\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial z^2} + \frac{8\pi^2m}{h^2}(E - V)\psi = 0$$
m = mass of an [[electrons]]
E = total [[energy]] of an [[electrons]]
V = potential [[energy]] of the [[electrons]]
h = planck's constant

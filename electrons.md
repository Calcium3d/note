# Discovery

In 1830, [[Micheal Faraday]] showed that if electricity is passed through a solution of an electrolyte, chemical reactions occured at the electrodes which resulted in the liberation and deposition of matter at the electrodes. The results suggested the particulate nature of electricy. 

In the mid 1850s, [[Micheal Faraday]] including other scientists studied electrical discharge in partially evacuated tubes, or cathode ray discharge tubes.

When a sufficiently high voltage at low pressure is applied across the electrodes, current flows through a stream of particles moving from the cathode to the anode, known as cathode rays. 

Interestingly, passing through a anode and hitting zinc sulphide causes a bright spot to form, hence CRT TVs

# Charge to Mass Ratio of Electron
In 1897, british physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] measured the ratio of electrical charge to the mass of electron by using cathode ray tube. 

* The magnitude of the negative charge on the particle, greater the magnitude of the charge on the particle, greater is the interaction with the electric or magnetic field and thus greater is the deflection
* The mass of the particle is inversely proportional to the deflection
* The strength of the electrical field is proportional to the increase in voltage across electrodes.

$$\frac{e}{m_e} = 1.758820 * 10^{11} C kg^{-1}$$

# Charge
[[R.A. Milikan]] devised a method known as the oil drop experiment to determine the charge on the electrons.

$$9.1094 * 10^{-31}kg$$

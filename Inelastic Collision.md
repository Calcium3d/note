# Define

If there is a loss of kinetic [[energy]] during a [[collision]], it is called an inelastic [[collision]]

# Characteristics
* The [[Momentum]] is conserved
* Total [[Energy]] is conserved
* The [[Kinetic Energy]] is not conserved
* Some or all of the [[Force]]s are [[Non-Conservative Force]]s
* A part of the [[Mechanical Energy]] is converted into heat, light, sound
